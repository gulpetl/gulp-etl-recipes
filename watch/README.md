This is a recipe for gulp.watch()

Gulp watch() is used to watch files so when something is dropped into a folder or a file is changed, it completes a predesignated task.
It takes in globs for it to know what to watch (which are explained [here](https://gulpjs.com/docs/en/api/concepts#globs)) options which are detailed [here](https://gulpjs.com/docs/en/api/watch#options)
